# To create an object literal in Python just create a class and inside of it pass all
# the key/value pairs into it. The reason why I didn't just use a dictionary is because
# to access the values I had to either use [] notation or the ".get()" method. But I 
# wanted it to be very simlilar to the NodeJS "http-status-codes" 3rd party package.
# Where it would go like this: StatusCodes.OK, StatusCodes.CREATED, so I went with 
# this way.
